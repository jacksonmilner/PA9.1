Bradley C. SpaceInvader clone Logs

12/8 Tuesday
Spontaneously thought to log start logging my activities today
Going to add a menu to the game window.

12/9
Morning- Yesterday, you fell asleep and did not finish the menu. Last night when you woke up, github was goin crazy
and you spent about 4 hours on the problem probably unnecessarily. You need to get it together. By the end of today
, you finish the menu and mess around with sprites.

4:43
You did not finish menu yet, coming close. Sprites may be a possible, think of adding one as a member of the 
bullet/alien/etc and updating its position with the corresponding object in run_app();
